# Welcome to @lenne.tech/ng-base

This is the base library of lenne.Tech for Angular.

## Description

This library contains all the basics to start a new project in combination with the lenne.Tech Nest Server:

- GraphQL service and elements for easy communication with GraphQL API (via Models)
- Standard Model with methods for mapping, cloning and comparing models
- Basic User Model with basic rights handling
- Loading Service for the subscription of loading processes
- Storage Service for comfortable saving of data in local storage
- GraphQL service and elements for easy communication with GraphQL API (via Models)
- Authentication service for user registration
- and much more

For setting up a new project we recommend our Angular Starter, which already contains this library and also includes a few sample elements as templates.
